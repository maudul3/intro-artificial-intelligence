Programming assignments for introductory coursework in artificial intelligence.

Assignments:

`programming1.py`: implementation of the A* and best-first search algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle (variant of 15-puzzle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). Three different heurisitcs are used for each algorithm to evaluate the states in the state space.

`programming2.py`: implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the 8-queens puzzle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). 

`programming3.py`: implementation of Q-learning (model-free, off-policy reinforcement learning) to train a robot to effectively pick up cans in a 10 x 10.
